The project is a two sides project, first we create the server side with AJAX, then we create the client side with the message display. The server holds a template for all the chatroom, therefore the client side can render it without creating a lot html files. We use JADE for the template. Besides, the server holds thedatabase for storing all the messages. The design of the chatroom is RESTful, welet the server side to keep track with the states, instead of the client side.

Two improvements can be done in the future, first, we can use the database to keep track of the number of users in the room, and show the most popular room at the top of the index page. Second, we can let the user to change the color of their messages.
